# Weather-Based Play Decision Prediction System

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning-based decision system that predicts whether outdoor activities (like playing sports) should be undertaken based on weather conditions. The system uses weather parameters to make binary classification decisions, demonstrating practical applications of ML in decision-making scenarios.

## Dataset Features
The weather dataset includes the following features:
- **outlook**: Weather outlook conditions (Sunny, Overcast, Rainy)
- **temperature**: Temperature readings (Hot, Mild, Cool)
- **humidity**: Humidity levels (High, Normal)
- **windy**: Wind conditions (True, False)
- **play**: Target variable - decision to play outdoor activities (Yes, No)

## Machine Learning Approach

### Libraries Used
- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy`: Numerical computations
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: Data visualization
- `seaborn`: Advanced statistical visualizations
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning algorithms

### Algorithms Implemented
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Instance-based learning for play/no-play classification
- **Logistic Regression**: Statistical model for binary decision prediction based on weather conditions
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with Gaussian distribution assumption

## Implementation Steps

### Data Preprocessing
- Load weather dataset with categorical features
- Encode categorical variables:
  - `outlook`: Sunny, Overcast, Rainy → numerical values
  - `temperature`: Hot, Mild, Cool → numerical values
